          <h2><strong>The most major tv studios!</strong></h2>

             <h2 style="font-size: 150%;background-color: rgb(217, 114, 210)"><u>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</u></h2>
             <p>Major film studios are production and distribution companies that release a substantial number of films annually and consistently command a significant share of box office revenue in a given market. In the American and international markets, the major film studios, often known simply as the majors or the Big Five studios, are commonly regarded as the five diversified media conglomerates whose various film production and distribution subsidiaries collectively command approximately 80 to 85% of U.S. box office revenue. The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary motion picture business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Overview</h3>
             <p>MGM was the last studio to convert to sound picturesâ€”nonetheless, from the end of the silent film era through the late 1950s, it was the dominant motion picture studio in Hollywood. It was slow to respond to the changing legal, economic, and demographic nature of the motion picture industry during the 1950s and 1960s; and although its films often did well at the box office, it lost significant amounts of money throughout the 1960s. In 1966, MGM was sold to Canadian investor Edgar Bronfman Sr., whose son Edgar Jr. would later buy Universal Studios. Three years later, an increasingly unprofitable MGM was bought by Kirk Kerkorian, who slashed staff and production costs, forced the studio to produce low-quality, low-budget fare, and then ceased theatrical distribution in 1973. The studio continued to produce five to six films a year that were distributed through other studios, usually United Artists. Kerkorian did, however, commit to increased production and an expanded film library when he bought United Artists in 1981.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Film library</h3>
             <p>Following his brief ownership of the company in 1986, Ted Turner formed Turner Entertainment Co. as a holding company for the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library and pre-1950 Warner Bros. film library which he retained. For several years after the sale, MGM continued to distribute home video releases of those films under license from Turner, though in 1990 it sold all of its home video distribution rights to Warner Bros. After Turner's holdings were purchased by Time Warner in 1996, the rights for the Turner-owned films were reassigned to Warner Home Video in 1999 when MGM ended their distribution deal with Warner Bros, though Turner Entertainment, as a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery, remains the credited copyright holder.</p>

             <h2 style="font-size: 150%;background-color:rgb(217, 114, 210)"><u>The Walt Disney Company</u></h2>
             <p>The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California. Disney was originally founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Studio; it also operated under the names the Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to the Walt Disney Company in 1986. Early on, the company established itself as a leader in the animation industry, with the creation of the widely popular character Mickey Mouse, who is the company's mascot, and the start of animated films.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">History</h3>
             <p>At Laugh-O-Gram Studio, a film studio in Kansas City founded by Walt Disney and his friend and animator Ub Iwerks, Walt made a short film entitled Alice's Wonderland. It featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. In 1923, soon after the short was made, Laugh-O-Gram Studio went bankrupt, but the short later became a hit after New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler purchased it. Walt signed a contract to create six Alice Comedies series, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Before the signing, Walt decided to move to Hollywood to join his brother Roy O. Disney because Roy had tuberculosis.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Legacy</h3>
             <p>The Walt Disney Company is one of the world's largest entertainment companies and is considered to be a pioneer in the animation industry, having produced 790 features with 122 of the being animated films. Many of their films are considered to be the greatest of all time, including films such as Pinocchio, Toy Story, Bambi, Ratatouille, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mary Poppins, and more. As of 2022, the company has won a combined total of 135 Academy Awards, with 32 of them coming from Walt. They have won 16 Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, 16 for Best Original Song, 15 for Best Animated Feature, 11 for Best Original Score, 5 for Best Documentary Feature, 5 for Best Visual Effects, and several others as well as a various amount of special awards. In addition, Disney has also won 29 Golden Globe Awards, 51 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards, and 36 Grammy Awards as of 2022. Disney has also created some of the most influential and memorable fictional characters of all time, such as Mickey Mouse, Woody, Captain America (MCU), Jack Sparrow, Iron Man (MCU), and Elsa.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Criticism and controversies</h3>
             <p>The Walt Disney Company has been criticized for the purportedly sexist and racist content in the past as well putting LGBT elements in their films and not having enough LGBT representation. There has also been controversies over alleged plagiarism, offering poor pay and working conditions, and treating animals poorly. Several films of Disney have been considered to be racist. One of Disney's most controversial films, Song of the South, was criticized for having wrongful stereotypes portrayed as racist. For that reason, the film was never released to home video or Disney+. Other things that have been called out as racist are Sunflower, the black centaurette who serves a white centaurette from Fantasia, the Siamese cats from Lady and the Tramp, who are considered to be overly exaggerated as Asians, stereotypes of the Native Americans tribe in Peter Pan, and the crows from Dumbo, who are depicted as African Americans that use jive, with their leader being named Jim Crow, which is considered to be a racist term referring to segregation laws. When watching a film on Disney+ considered to have wrongful racist stereotypes, Disney added a disclaimer before the film starts to help avoid controversies.</p>

             <h2 style="font-size: 150%;background-color:rgb(217, 114, 210)"><u>Warner Bros.</u></h2>
             <p>Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (commonly known as Warner Bros. or abbreviated as WB) is an American film and entertainment studio headquartered at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California, and a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. Founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner, the company established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video games and is one of the "Big Five" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">History</h3>
             <p>The company's name originated from the founding Warner brothers (born Wonsal, Woron and Wonskolaser before Anglicization): Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Harry, Albert and Sam emigrated as young children with their Polish-Jewis mother to the United States from Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire), in October 1889, a year after their father emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed "Sam"), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner. Jack, the youngest brother, was born in London, Ontario, during the family's two-year residency in Canada.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Code era</h3>
             <p>In the 1930s many actors and actresses who had characterized the realistic pre-Code era, but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures, disappeared. Warner Bros. remained a top studio in Hollywood, but this changed after 1935 as other studios, notably MGM, quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized Warner Bros. However, in the late 1930s, Bette Davis became the studio's top draw and was even dubbed as "The Fifth Warner Brother."</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">The Warner Bros. Archives</h3>
             <p>The University of Southern California Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to USC's School of Cinema-Television by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio's first major feature, My Four Years in Germany (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968. It presents a complete view of the production process during the Golden Age of Hollywood. UA donated pre-1950 Warner Bros. nitrate negatives to the Library of Congress and post-1951 negatives to the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Most of the company's legal files, scripts, and production materials were donated to the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research.</p>

             <h2 style="font-size: 150%;background-color:rgb(217, 114, 210)"><u>Paramount Pictures</u></h2>
             <p>Paramount Pictures Corporation is an American film and television production and distribution company and the main namesake division of Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS). It is the fifth-oldest film studio in the world, the second-oldest film studio in the United States (behind Universal Pictures), and the sole member of the "Big Five" film studios located within the city limits of Los Angeles.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">History</h3>
             <p>Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world; after the French studios Gaumont Film Company (1895) and PathÃ© (1896), Titanus (1904), followed by the Nordisk Film company (1906), and Universal Studios (1912). It is the last major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Investments</h3>
             <p>In 2006, Paramount became the parent of DreamWorks Pictures. Soros Strategic Partners and Dune Entertainment II soon afterwards acquired controlling interest in live-action films released through DreamWorks, with the release of Just Like Heaven on September 16, 2005. The remaining live-action films released until March 2006 remained under direct Paramount control. However, Paramount still owns distribution and other ancillary rights to Soros and Dune films.</p>
             <h3 style="font-size: 100%;">Other interests</h3>
             <p>In March 2012, Paramount licensed their name and logo to a luxury hotel investment group which subsequently named the company Paramount Hotels and Resorts. The investors plan to build 50 hotels throughout the world based on the themes of Hollywood and the California lifestyle. Among the features are private screening rooms and the Paramount library available in the hotel rooms. In April 2013, Paramount Hotels and Dubai-based DAMAC Properties announced the building of the first resort: "DAMAC Towers by Paramount."</p>
