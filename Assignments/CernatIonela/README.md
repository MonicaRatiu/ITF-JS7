Instructions for Assignments

First time
Use this folder to create a new folder with your own name. Use either complete camelCase (e.g. IonutPopescu) or underscores 
(e.g. Ionut_Popescu) but please don't use whitespaces or any other weird characters. As a matter of fact, learn to never use 
anything other than English letters, numbers, and the underscore character when naming files, variables, etc.

Next
Upload each assignment inside the folder with your own name, and name the folder with the id of that assignment (e.g. WD07). 
Before adding your files to the shared repository, make sure you first PULL the remote changes, otherwise you won't be able to push.

Important
When adding a project, make sure ALL elements are present (images, style files, etc.) and they all have the right path and work.
 Also make sure that all links from your project work, and that it all looks nice on different resolutions (especially mobile phones and tablets).
